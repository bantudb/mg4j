MG4J (Managing Gigabytes for Java) is a free full-text search engine for
large document collections written in Java. This distribution is the big
version of MG4J, which is able to handle up to 2^63 terms and documents.
Indices written by the standard version of MG4J are usable with the big
version.

The starting point for understanding MG4J is a look at the overview of the
Javadoc documentation, and at the manual. Then, the Javadoc class
documentation can provide more insights. Please look at the overview
section for package dependencies.

We know that the documentation is not complete, and sometimes difficult to
locate. Please report any major difficulties in understanding a part of MG4J,
so we can build better docs!

MG4J is free software distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License.
