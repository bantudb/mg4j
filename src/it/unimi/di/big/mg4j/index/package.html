    <P>Index generation and access.

    <P>This package contains the classes that handle index generation and
    access.  The interval iterators defined in {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.search}
	build upon the classes of this package to provide answer to queries using interval semantics,
	but it is also possible to access an index directly.
	
	<P>You can easily build indices using the tools in {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.tool}. Once an index
	has been built, it can be opened using an {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.Index} object, which
	gathers metadata that is necessary to access the index. You do not create an  {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.Index}
	with a constructor: rather, you use the static factory {@link  
	it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.Index#getInstance(CharSequence)} (or one of its variants) to create an instance.
	This is necessary so that different kind of indices can be treated transparently: for example, the factory
	may return a {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.cluster.IndexCluster} if the index is actually a cluster,
	but you do not need to know that.
	
	<P>From an {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.Index},
	you can easily obtain either an {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.IndexReader}, which allows to
	scan sequentially or randomly the index. In turn from an {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.IndexReader}
	you can obtain a {@link  it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.IndexIterator}
	returning the documents containing a certain term and the position of the term within the document.

	<P>But there is more: an {@link  it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.IndexIterator}
		is a kind of {@link  it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.search.DocumentIterator}, and 
		{@link  it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.search.DocumentIterator}s can be combined in several ways
	using the classes of the package {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.search}: for instance, you can combine
	document iterators using AND/OR. Note that you can combine document iterators on <em>different</em>
	indices, but of course the operation is meaningful only if the two indices contain different information
	about the same document collection (e.g., title and main text).
	
	<P>More importantly, if the index is full text (the default) for each document containing the term you can get
		interval iterators that return intervals representing extents of text satisfying the query: for 
		instance, in case of an AND of two terms, the intervals will contain <em>both</em> terms.
		
		
    <H2>Structure of an inverted index</H2>
    
    <P>An inverted index is made by a sequence of inverted lists (one inverted
    list for each term). Inverted lists are made by document records: each
    document record contains information about the occurrences of the term
    within a certain document.

    <P>The number of documents in which a term appear, that is, the length
    of the inverted list of the term, is called the <em>{@linkplain it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.IndexIterator#frequency() frequency}</em>.

    <P>Each document record contains the (document) <em>{@linkplain it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.IndexIterator#document() pointer}</em>,
    which identifies the document within the collection; optionally, 
    the <em>{@linkplain it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.IndexIterator#count() count}</em>, that is, the number of times
    the term appears in the given document (it is also common to call the count &ldquo;within-document frequency&rdquo;, but we find this
    usage confusing); finally, optionally we might have the <em>{@linkplain it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.IndexIterator#nextPosition() positions}</em>
    in which the term occurs. Some indices store also a user-defined <em>{@linkplain it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.IndexIterator#payload() payload}</em>.
    
    <p>Traditional indices are based on <em>gap encoding</em> techniques: sequence of increasing integers, such as document pointers,
    are stored by writing the gaps between successive pointers using suitable instantaneous codes. MG4J supports this kind
    of indices (see {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.BitStreamIndexWriter} and {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.BitStreamHPIndexWriter}), 
    but since version 5.0 the default index is a new kind of {@linkplain it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.QuasiSuccinctIndexWriter quasi-succinct index}
    that has major performance improvements with respect to traditional gap-encoded indices. Gap-based interleaved indices
    (see {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.BitStreamIndexWriter} and {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.SkipBitStreamIndexWriter}) are used
    during index construction, for payload indices, and should be considered when indices are not to be directly queried 
    (in which a {@linkplain it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.index.QuasiSuccinctIndexWriter quasi-succinct index} is unbeatable) but rather
    further manipulated.
