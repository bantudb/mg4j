This package contains all the logics related to and useful for managing documents, document collections and such.

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> We are still working on the document infrastructure. It should be pretty stable, but
changes should not be unexpected. Suggestions are welcome. Note also that most of the classes in this
package should be considered examples and suggestions: while a casual user will find them
invaluable in indexing data, a custom, large-scale application will usually require writing your own 
{@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentCollection}.

<h2>Basic interfaces</h2>

<h3>The {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.Document} interface</h3>

<p><code>MG4J</code> aims at indexing the content of entities called documents.	The main 
classes that describe documents and sets of documents are included in the <code>it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document</code> 
package. In particular, documents are instances of the {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.Document}
interface. A document is characterized abstractly by the following data:
<ul>
  <li> a <em>title</em>, a character sequence that represents the document; the document title is 
    returned by the {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.Document#title()} method;
  <li> a URI, that somehow characterizes the document uniquely; the document URI is returned by 
    the {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.Document#uri()} method;
  <li>a number of <em>fields</em>; every field is abstractly represented by a number, the <em>field index</em>; 
    fields are numbered from 0, but the user should know how many fields a document exhibits, because this 
    information is not available in the document itself. For every field, the document exhibits the following data:
    <ul>
       <li> the field content, that is an <code>Object</code> returned by the 
         {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.Document#content(int)} method; the type of object that 
         this method returns must be known by the calling class in advance; in particular, for 
	        textual fields (see below), the content will be a {@link java.io.Reader};
       <li> for textual fields only, a {@linkplain it.unimi.dsi.io.WordReader word reader}: 
       	an object that is able to split the field 
         content (in this case: a sequence of characters) into a sequence of words; the word reader 
         is returned by the {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.Document#wordReader(int)} 
         method (which must be called only for textual fields).
    </ul>
  </ul>

<p>Users should always close a document after usage by calling the {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.Document#close()} 
method: the method is responsible for relinquishing all resources that a document instantiated for its very existence.

<h3>The {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentFactory} interface</h3>

<p>Documents usually do not come alone, but they are grouped into collections: documents within a collection are 
of the same type, and this fact explains why the document structure (number and type of fields) are not contained in 
the document itself. Indeed, documents are produced by document factories.

<p>A document factory is an instance of the {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentFactory} interface, that in 
particular is able to produce a document. All documents produced by the same factory are of the same kind, and exhibit 
the same number and type of fields. A factory gives information about the documents it produces through the following methods:
   <ul>
     <li> {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentFactory#numberOfFields()}: returns the number of fields contained 
       in each document produced by this factory; recall that fields are indexed starting from 0;
     <li> {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentFactory#fieldName(int)}: returns a mnemonic explanatory name 
       for the given field;
     <li> {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentFactory#fieldIndex(String)}: returns the index of a field, given its mnemonic
     name;
     <li> {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentFactory#fieldType(int)}: returns (an integer representing) 
       the type of the given field; possible types are static constants declared in the {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentFactory.FieldType} 
       interface; one of the possible types is {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentFactory.FieldType#TEXT}, used for textual 
       fields; note that the type of objects returned by the {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.Document#content(int)} 
       method of the {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.Document} interface depend on the type of the field.
   </ul>

<p>The abovementioned methods provide information about documents produced by the factory. The actual documents are 
produced by the {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentFactory#getDocument(java.io.InputStream,it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.objects.Reference2ObjectMap) getDocument(rawContent,metadata)}
method.

<p>This method returns a new document from the factory. The <code>rawContent</code> parameter is
the most important one: it is a stream 
of bytes that the factory uses to produce the document. 
The factory knows how the sequence of bytes should be interpreted 
to produce a document of the desired kind.
Note that even though the interpretation of the sequence of bytes representing the raw
document content is entirely left to implementors, often you 
might prefer to think of the input byte sequence as of a list of consecutive self-delimiting byte 
subsequences, one for each field: in this case, the 
{@link java.io.InputStream#reset()} method of the {@link java.io.InputStream} class is used to divide the 
subsequences from one another.

<p>The <code>metadata</code> parameter is a map providing some basic
data about the document as derived by the collection. The map is a <em>reference</em> map with 
suitable {@link java.lang.Enum} keys, and as such must be
queried using the keys in {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.PropertyBasedDocumentFactory.MetadataKeys}, or other
similar factory-specific keys. For instance, the key {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.PropertyBasedDocumentFactory.MetadataKeys#TITLE}
gives a suggested title to  the document (but the factory may ignore it, if it has a better way to determine
a title for the document), whereas {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.PropertyBasedDocumentFactory.MetadataKeys#URI} specifies a suggested URI for
the document (which, once more, may be ignored by the factory).

<p>Usually, a factory is built using a list of <em>properties</em> that define default values for metadata such as charset
encoding or MIME types. There properties can be passed in several ways, and usually the main method of a collection
provides an option (typically, <samp>-p</samp>) that let the user specify default metadata for the factory. The
property resolution algorithm is explained in the documentation for 
{@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.PropertyBasedDocumentFactory}.

<h3>The {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentSequence} interface</h3>

<p>Up to this point, we have interpreted documents and document factories in a very abstract manner, but we gave no 
importance on the way the byte sequences representing the raw data are produced.

<p>Basically, a source of documents is a {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentSequence}. More precisely, instances of 
this class represent sources that are able to generate documents. Typically, a document sequence is able to produce a 
stream of documents after one another, through a special kind of iterator, called 
{@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentIterator}, returned by the {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentSequence#iterator()} method.

<p>A document iterator is not really a Java {@link java.util.Iterator}: it is simply a class that 
exposes a method {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentIterator#nextDocument()} that returns the next document, 
if any, or <code>null</code> when there are no more documents. Thus, document iterators can be <em>lazy</em>, which
is preferrable in several circumstance (e.g., documents coming from an input stream).

<h3>The {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentCollection} interface</h3>

<p>In some cases, the documents only appear as an uninterrupted stream and applications do not have direct accesses to 
single documents; in particular, it might be the case that documents just disappear after being enumerated (as it happens
when the document source is standard input). In all such situations, a {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentSequence}
provides the only way to get the documents, because it only guarantees sequential access.

<p>Nonetheless, there are other cases where documents can be easily accessed in a direct fashion, and can be read many
times (for example, when documents are files in the file system). In such cases, {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentCollection} 
(an extension of {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentSequence})
can be used.

<p>Apart for the methods of a document sequence, a document collection provides the following additional access methods
to the documents:

<ul>
  <li> {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentCollection#size()}, that returns the collection size, i.e., the number
    of documents in the collection;  
  <li> {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentCollection#document(long)}, that returns the document with given pointer; 
    the <em>document pointer</em> is an integer representing uniquely a document within the collection: the <var>i</var>-th
    document produced by the collection's {@linkplain it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentCollection#iterator() document iterator}
    has pointer <var>i</var>&minus;1 (so, document pointers range from 0, inclusive, to <code>size()</code>, exclusive);
  <li> {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentCollection#stream(long)}, that returns the {@link java.io.InputStream} of raw data
    that this collection would use to produce the document with given pointer.
</ul>

<p>After a document collection has been created, for example, starting from a set of files in the file system, it can usually
be saved (serialized) on a file: the extension used for the filename is, by default, {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentCollection#DEFAULT_EXTENSION}.
Implementors of this interface should always specify <strong>explicitly</strong> which assumptions on the existence of
external data are made for the consistency of a collection to be preserved. For example, a collection produced from a set of
files will be consistent until no file has been changed or deleted; if the latter situation happens, the collection usually
becomes inconsistent, and in any case you might expect that the indices thereof produced will no longer match the content
of the collection. 

<p>Note that a document collection has <strong>very weak</strong> requirements (and thus
very weak obligations) on the concurrent creation of several objects (documents, iterators, etc.). Please read carefully the
{@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentCollection class description}.</p>

<h3>Relations between document sequences/collections and document factories</h3>

<p>As we explained above, document sequences/collections extract raw data (byte sequences) from some source and use
a specified document factory to turn such data into documents. Hence, there exists a tight connection between each document
sequence and the document factory it uses. 

<p>Typically, the document factory is provided to the document sequence at construction time, and this fact provides a form of 
flexibility, because different sources (e.g., the file system and the standard input) may be coupled with the same document
factory (e.g., a document factory parsing HTML documents into text), or, conversely, the same document source may be
used to produce documents with different formats.

<p>Users should always be careful, however. Often, document sequences make assumptions about the factory they use, which
reduces the number of possible combinations the user may adopt. Implementors of the {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentSequence}
interface should always clarify all the assumptions they make about the factories that can be used for the sequence.

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: it is a common mistake forgetting to specify some property (typically, the character encoding) for the factory
when creating a document sequence (or collection). This problem cannot be detected at construction time because, 
in principle, the document sequence could guess the property and pass it to the factory. The problem arises, usually, in the indexing
phase, when the first document is retrieved. We realise that this is confusing and counterintuitive&mdash;the collection has <em>already</em>
been created and serialized, so what's the problem?&mdash;but there is no way to check what the sequence will do with a particular document.

<h2>Document factories</h2>

<p>Recall that a document factory is an object that is capable of producing homogeneous documents (documents with the
same number/type of fields). Every document is produced starting from a raw bytestream. 
 
<h3>The {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.IdentityDocumentFactory}</h3>

<p>The simplest possible document factory is the {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.IdentityDocumentFactory}: this factory 
produces documents with a single textual field, called <samp>text</samp>, that is actually obtained by transforming the
byte sequence into a sequence of characters, using some default encoding. Actually, a
document factory must also provide a way to break the text into words. With this aim, the identity factory may be provided
with a {@link java.util.Locale} that is used to determine how words are best broken in the given locale's language.

<h3>Other examples of document factories</h3>

<p>Other implementations of document factories that are provided with <code>MG4J</code> are:
<ul>
  <li> {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.HtmlDocumentFactory}: a factory used to parse HTML documents; this factory 
    produces documents by parsing HTML streams. Bytes are converted into characters using a specified encoding; 
    the resulting HTML character sequence is parsed to extract text (that is returned as
    a textual field named <samp>text</samp>) and title (the HTML title element, returned as a textual field named
    <samp>title</samp>). The title, if present, is also used as document title (otherwise, the suggested title is used).
    Note that a document collection might have information about the charset encoding (e.g., by means of HTTP headers):
    in this case the <code>metadata</code> field of {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.DocumentFactory#getDocument(java.io.InputStream,it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.objects.Reference2ObjectMap)}
    should pass this information.
  <li> The package {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.tika} provides factories based on <a href="http://tika.apache.org/">Tika</a>. 
</ul> 

<h3>Composing document factories</h3>

<p>As we said, many document factories interpret the raw content data (an {@link java.io.InputStream}, i.e., a sequence
of bytes) as if it is really made by a concatenation of many {@link java.io.InputStream}s, where each stream is typically
parsed to a field; to pass from one stream to the next, the {@link java.io.InputStream#reset()} method is called.

<p>Suppose you have <var>n</var> document factories <var>D</var><sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, <var>D</var><sub><var>n</var></sub>, 
with <var>f</var><sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, <var>f</var><sub><var>n</var></sub> fields, respectively. One may want to
build a new factory with <var>f</var><sub>1</sub>+&hellip;+<var>f</var><sub><var>n</var></sub> fields, where each document
is produced by composing the document factories <var>D</var><sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, <var>D</var><sub><var>n</var></sub> sequentially:
in other words, the raw data are first passed to the first factory (that extracts <var>f</var><sub>1</sub> fields, typically
resetting the stream as many times), then it is passed to the second factory (that extracts <var>f</var><sub>2</sub> fields)
etc.

<p>The {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.CompositeDocumentFactory} does the job, and also allows one to change the field
names (that are otherwise named as they were in the subfactories).

<p>The class {@link it.unimi.dsi.io.MultipleInputStream} is a useful tool to produce raw data for composite factories:
it allows one to convert an array of input streams into a single input stream: each time the resulting stream is reset,
the multiple input stream will offer you the next stream in the array.

<p>A special form of composite document factory is obtained using {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.ReplicatedDocumentFactory},
that allows one to compose sequentially the same document factory with itself a certain number of times.

<h2>Document collections and sequences</h2>

<h3>The {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.InputStreamDocumentSequence}</h3>

<p>This is the simplest kind of document sequence: it just breaks a single {@link java.io.InputStream} on the basis of a given
separator character; each piece of the stream is interpreted as the raw data corresponding to a document, and it is passed
to a factory (specified at construction time) for converting it into a {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.Document}.

<h3>The {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.FileSetDocumentCollection}</h3>

<p>This kind of collection is built starting from a set of files in the file system. Each file is interpreted as a document, and
passed to a factory (specified at construction time). The suggested title for a document is the corresponding filename, and the
suggested URI is the URI of the file. 
 
<h3>The {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.ZipDocumentCollection} facility</h3>

<p>There are cases in which one would like to turn a document sequence into a document collection. This may happen for one of the
following reasons:
  <ul>
     <li>the sequence is, by its very nature, volatile (e.g., it is coming from standard input, and cannot be re-produced),
       but we would like to make it into a resident non-volatile collection;
     <li>the sequence is not amenable to be accessed at random;
     <li>the documents in the sequence are difficult to parse, and it is not advisable to repeat the parsing process every
       time they are accessed.
  </ul>

<p>In all such cases, it may be advisable to produce a compact copy of the sequence that is easily and efficiently accessible at random.
To do this, one may use the {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.ZipDocumentCollectionBuilder}, that takes a document sequence
and produces a "zipped clone" of the documents in the sequence: there are some mild limitations to the sequences that can
be used in this context, and the resulting collection is only a partial copy of the original one, but in most cases this is
sufficient for all indexing purposes. The builder will save two files: one contains the essential data concerning the zipped
collection, and the other contains the zipped version of the documents. 

<p>After this, the produced {@link it.unimi.di.big.mg4j.document.ZipDocumentCollection} may be used as any other collection.
