      them in a single index (in the <code class="classname">IndexBuilder</code>
      example, combination has been handled for you). Note that MG4J allows
      you to combine <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> set of indices, which means, for
      instance, that if your collection is split in several piece you can
      index the pieces separately and combine them later. MG4J distinguish
      three type of index combination:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><em class="firstterm">Concatenation</em> takes a list of indices
          and builds a new index as follows: the first document of the second
          index is renumbered to the number of documents of the first index,
          and the others follow; the first document of the third index is
          renumbered to the sum of number of documents of the first and second
          index, and so on. The resulting index is identical to the index that
          would be produced by indexing the <span class="emphasis"><em>concatenation</em></span>
          of document sequences producing each index. This is the kind of
          combination that is applied to batches, unless documents were
          renumbered.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><em class="firstterm">Merging</em> assumes that each index
          contains a separate subset of documents, with non-overlapping
          number, and merges the lists accordingly. In case a document appears
          in two indices, the merge operation is stopped. Note that no
          renumbering is performed. This is the kind of combination that is
          applied to batches when documents have been renumbered, and each
          batch contains potentially non-consecutive document numbers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><em class="firstterm">Pasting</em> relaxes further the assumptions
          of merging: each index is assumed to index a (possibly empty) part
          of a document. For each term and document, the positions of the term
          in the document are gathered (and possibly suitably renumbered). If
          the inputs that have been indexed are text files with newline as
          separator, the resulting index is identical to the one that would be
          obtained by applying the UN*X command <span class="command"><strong>paste</strong></span> to
          the text files. This is the kind of combination that is applied to
          <span class="emphasis"><em>virtual documents</em></span>, described in the next
          section.</p></li></ol></div><p>Please consult the Javadoc of the package
