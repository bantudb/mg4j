As a
      general rule, <span class="emphasis"><em>nonparametric codes are quicker than parametric
      codes</em></span>. Thus, Golomb codes for document pointers have an
      excellent compression rate, but δ codes have very good compression, too,
      and can be decoded more quickly. The point here is that for unary, γ,
      shifted γ and δ codes MG4J uses <span class="emphasis"><em>precomputed decoding
      tables</em></span> that speed up decompression by an order of magnitude.
      The default choice (γ for frequencies, δ for pointers, γ for counts, and
      δ for positions) is very reasonable. For maximum speed you could even
      try to use γ everywhere (as it is quicker to decode if the precomputed
      decoding tables fail).</p><p>Another important trick is that of discarding what you don't need.
      The default MG4J index type is called
      <span class="emphasis"><em>high-performance</em></span>: it contains all information
      (pointers, counts, positions) but it is only partially
      interleaved―positions are kept in a separate file. This satisfies most
      needs, but If you are just using BM25 or TF/IDF scoring, there is no
      need to store positions in your index: you can force a standard,
      interleaved index, and store just what you need (e.g.,
      <code class="option">-cPOSITIONS:NONE</code> will eliminate positions from the
      index).</p><p>By default, indices contain a <em class="firstterm">skipping
      structure</em> that makes skipping index entries faster. Skipping
      structures introduce a slight overhead when scanning sequentially a list
      (so you should disable them using the <code class="option">--no-skips</code> option
      if you don't need them), but in general they make query processing
      significantly faster. Skipping structure are based on two parameters:
      the <em class="firstterm">quantum</em> <code class="varname">q </code>and the
      <em class="firstterm">height</em> <code class="varname">h</code>. The quantum dictates
      how often the skipping structure should index positions in the inverted
      list. The height dictates how far the skipping structure is able to jump
      in one shot (an index is able to skip in one shot as far as
      <code class="varname">q</code>2<sup>h</sup>). However, as
      <code class="varname">h</code> grows the memory required to build the skip
      structures grow exponentially: the rule of thumb is setting
      <code class="varname">h</code> as large as possible without incurring in
      out-of-memory errors.</p><p>Sizing the quantum is a more complex issue, as it depends on the
      structure of the inverted list. Dense inverted lists require smaller
      quanta. Since version 3.0, MG4J makes it possible to just specify the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>percentage</em></span> of the index size occupied by the
      skipping structure, and let some machinery compute the correct quantum.
      You can also specify a quantum explicitly, but it will be the same for
      all lists, which is usually not a good thing.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch03s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 3. Performance </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Setup Time</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
